# Push-Pull-SSTC-mini
This SSTC circuit was originate from @skoriweb and was later revision by @tefatronix. But this circuit is improved with Protection circuit  which make them more versatile for DIY builds. In this design we will cover the detials for building this amazing and genius design for our modern Solid-State Tesla Coil. Still an on going project
